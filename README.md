# üñåÔ∏è More Colors!

A simple Blender add-on that makes working with vertex colors easier.

## ‚ú® Features

- üëÅÔ∏è Preview vertex colors from object and edit modes
- üñåÔ∏è Various tools, including **simple selection fill**, **random color generator**, and a **gradient generator**
- üé≠ RGBA color masking, modify only the channels you need

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- [Blender 3.1 or higher](https://www.blender.org/download/)

## üîß Installation

## üìí Getting Started

After installing the add-on, you can see it on the side panel (press **N** to open it). It should look something like this: insert a screenshot here.
As you can see, it consists of several main sections, including **About**, **Settings** and **Tools** sections.

### About Section

Contains general info about the plugin such as add-on name and version, as well as a link to this documentation.

### Settings Section

Contains various settings, including **display settings** and **global color settings**.

#### Display Settings

With display settings, you can control vertex color visibility. Make sure it's on before using any of the tools!

#### Global Color Settings

The add-on has two settings here: a **color mask** and a **reset colors button**.

With the color mask, you can restrict, which RGBA channels are affected by add-on tools. Every channel is on by default, which means colors are applied as usual.
But imagine you left only the red channel on. In this case, **only the red channel values will be modified**, and values on other channels **will not be affected**.
Why do we need this? Well, you can use different color channels to store different information that will be used later (for instance in shaders). As an example, your red channel might be a position gradient, your blue channel might be some kind of a mask, and so on.

A reset colors button just **sets all vertex colors to white**.

## ü™õ Tools

Contains all the tools the add-on has to offer. At the moment it has a **Simple Fill**, a **Random Color Per Element**, and a **Color By Position** tool.

### Simple Fill Tool

It applies a selected color to the selected object(s) or selected parts of the mesh (points, edges, or faces).
Also has four preset colors, you can assign them as your main color with a select button, or immediately apply them to the mesh with a quick apply button.

### Random Color Per Element Tool

Applies a random color to the selected object(s). Doesn`t support applying colors to parts of the mesh.
There are several elements per which random colors will be generated:

- Points
- Vertices
- Faces

The difference between points and vertices is that a point can share several vertices, but a vertex is the smallest unit and cannot be divided into something else.

Also, you can choose, how colors will be generated. There are two modes: **RGB** and **Hue** random.
RGB random colors are colors, where each component (red, green, and blue values) are independently generated numbers in a range from zero to one.
Hue random colors are generated by creating an HSV (hue, saturation, value) color representation first, randomizing the hue value, and then converting it back to RGB space. It produces more distinct results, which might be useful for ID maps for example.

### Color By Position Tool

Generates a linear gradient, based on vertex position along a selected direction. You can choose between generating a gradient in the object's local space (rotation affects the direction of the gradient) or in world space (object rotation doesn't affect the gradient direction).
